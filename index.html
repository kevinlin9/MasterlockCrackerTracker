			<div class = "info"><b>Instructions</b> <br/> Enter the number that you are testing as the first number. You will then enter T or F depending on whether or not the second number test worked or not. If the lock <b>does not click </b> after turning the dial clockwise and counter-clockwise, type F. If the lock <b>clicks </b> then type T. You will be prompted to enter the number the dial clicked on and then be shown the combination numbers of your lock.</div>
